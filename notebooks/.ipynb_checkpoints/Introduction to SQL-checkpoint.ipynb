    "## What is a Database \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed, modified, protected and analysed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Two main types of modern databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The two main types of modern databases to choose from are relational and non-relational\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational /SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "* A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.\n",
    "* They have a table-based data structure, with a strict, predefined schema required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-relational/ NoSQL \n",
    "* NoSQL databases, or non-relational databases, can be document based, graph databases, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases don’t require any predefined schema, allowing you to work more freely with “unstructured data.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a database as a collection of tables, where each table is a collection of rows and columns.\n",
    " Conceptually, these tables exist in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logical: \n",
    "The logical view of a table is the way the data is organized and presented to the user. This is the view you see when you query a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Physical:\n",
    "The physical view of a table is the way the data is stored on disk. This is the view you see when you look at the underlying files that make up the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are designed to optimize for the logical view of a table, which is the view that users interact with. However, the physical view of a table is also important, as it determines how the data is stored and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DBMS (Database Management System)\n",
    "- Database Management System (DBMS) is a software that is used to define, create and maintain a database and provides controlled access to the data. They are RDBMS & NoSQL.\n",
    "- Or just a software used to manage a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Database Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "- A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. \n",
    "- Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### RDBMS examples include\n",
    "* MySQL, \n",
    "* PostgreSQL, \n",
    "* Oracle DB\n",
    "* SQL Server\n",
